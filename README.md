pyROT
-----

This is the trivial child of brython, a python implementation in javascript, and rot.js a roguelike library.

The interaction between python and javascript is rather fragile. While it is relatively safe to call js from python, the converse requires wrappers. See wrappers in `index.html` for examples.

The rot API is unchanged and some constructs might not be very pythonic.
